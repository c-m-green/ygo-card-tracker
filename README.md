# ygo-card-tracker
A simple JavaFX application that I created to help me keep track of my Yu-Gi-Oh! card collection.

This project began as a practical way for me to get better at SQL (using H2), but, the further into it I got, the more my plans grew to eventually aim to simulate a table-top duel. This part of the program has yet to materialize, though a broken button remains on the main menu.

Some of the neat features that *did* make it in include the automatic acquisition of card information from YGOProDeck's API, Deck construction, and grouping of cards. (Those last two are in a rough, but functional, state.)

I probably won't add many new features here. At most, I would like to extend the current compatability with YGOProDeck's card collections (for instance, this app can already export set codes that can be imported in YGOProDeck). Other than that, I may improve things like Deck assembly and grouping. Duel simulation may not happen.
